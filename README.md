CS-230 Operating Platforms
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a software company with an already launched game title, Draw It or Lose It, looking to expand into other platforms. The company 
is looking for ways best to recode into the most platforms for a wider audience.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I broke down the positives and negatives/strengths and weaknesses for Mac, Linux, Windows, and Mobile Devices well.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I found the requirements and design constraints portion to be the most helpful. This serves to be the foundation of any new project and lays out 
the starting point and boundaries of the project.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could choose one part, it would be the operating platform recommendation. I feel I got a bit too specific with it. Looking back, I would have 
choosen Windows.

How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when
designing?

It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because if you do not serve the end user, no one will user your product. 
The user's needs include an efficient operating system and a game that runs seemlessly. I believe this was implemented with best storage practices
and memory management techniques.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing software from the lens of the client and the end user.
